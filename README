RSStoFriendika is a program to post items from RSS feeds to Friendika. The items are formatted using templates before posting.

Usage:
1) Create a file containing RSS URL and path to template on each line
e.g.
http://myblog.org/feed.rss templates/generic_summary.templ
http://myphotos.org/feed.rss templates/generic_photo.templ

Optionally you may also include a comma separated list of groups (numeric) that are allowed to view the posts:
http://myblog.org/feed.rss templates/generic_summary.templ 1,2

2) run RSStoFriendika.py
